I've been playing with Alpine Linux and Docker for the last few weeks. I've
decided that Docker with an immutable Alpine Linux installation achieves
everything I want from encapsulation without locking me into a vendor (i.e.
SnapCraft), and also allowing me room for scaling up (i.e. kubernetes). And
now I have several private web services and *this very web page* running
through this architecture.

On the side I've been working on Golang as a Python replacement in my long-
term projects. That's been going swimmingly, and it can't have come at a better
time, seeing as the Python community is currently self-destructing. PEP 572
convinced me two years ago that Python has no room for growth into the future,
and consequently I'm unsurprised with the reception of PEP 622. And then
there's that PR on PEP 8...

And to top it all off, while I wasn't looking,
[Notable](https://github.com/notable/notable) went proprietary! So now I'm
teaching myself TypeScript and Electron towards the end of maintaining a
fork.
