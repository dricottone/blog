I moved to Chicago a Little while ago. D.C. just wasn't my kind of city. I'm
really enjoying Illinois so far, and I'm **really** really looking forward to
the winter.

But also, I moved this site into the cloud. My new ISP isn't so generous with
the whole 'wide-open ports' thing. I was faced with a choice: I could move this
site to the EC2 instance where my [wiki](https://wiki.dominic-ricottone.com)
lives. Or I could setup a cloud-based tunnel to smuggle packets past my
unscrupulous ISP.

I'm embarrassed to say that I took a long time to make that decision.

Somewhere along the way, I lost track of why I was self-hosting. I have been
putting the cart before the horse for too long. The content that I serve up
publicly is not data that needs to be kept on-premises. I'm sacrificing
bandwidth, flexibility, up-time, and my own sanity just for a buzz word label.

Enough is enough, I moved everything to the cloud and washed my hands of self-
hosting public web domains. So, this site has **also** moved.

I cannot recommend self-hosting enough to those just starting out with web
hosting. It's a very cheap way to try new things, make mistakes, and take time
learning how to fix them. But there will come a day where all is right with the
world and you don't want to deal with the headaches anymore.
