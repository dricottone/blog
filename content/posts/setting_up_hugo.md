This post-the first post, in fact-is to commemorate the launch of my new
website powered by Hugo. Prior to this moment, I was simply posting HTML files
to my server's webroot. It was appealing to be bare-bones and fast.

But now, I'm able to play around with many more powerful features. I can test
my CSS and Javascript more quickly with development servers on localhost. The
parts of the site that never change (i.e., navigation) are included where
needed and never in the way of the content.

And in case it wasn't obvious, I can also add a blog with relative ease.

I didn't need to give up any degree of portability (as the static site can live
in any webroot) or my workflow (since Hugo is perfectly happy being called by
`make` and being versioned by `git`).

All in all, very happy with this adoption of Hugo.
