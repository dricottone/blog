I am a data management analyst in the field of market research.
Currently I work at Fors Marsh Group, which specializes in federal
contracts. My caseload includes:

+ JAMRS Futures Survey
+ FVAP Overseas Citizens Population Survey
+ Active Duty Military Post-Election Voting Survey
+ NIST Manufacturing Extension Program Evaluation
+ FirstNet Economic Evaluation

I have experience across research operations, from programming web
surveys to computing weights.

I live in Chicago but have spent most of my life in Western New York.
I discovered my passion for programming and computer hardware after I'd
already gone to school for Political Science and Economics.

My current side projects are:

+ fleshing out my [personal wiki](https://wiki.dominic-ricottone.com) with
  helpful documentation for statistical programming and server administration,
  as well as transcribing my old college notes
+ a static website generator for EPUB e-books
