I was born in Buffalo, New York and spent the first two decades of my life in the Western New York region. I've relocated to the nation's capitol in search of work--my goal is to conduct survey research that informs policy decisions.

I have a personal interest in internet technologies and automation through programming. This website and the webserver hosting it are both weekend DIY projects. My current projects are:

+ converting this website to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)
+ a media player in the style of ncmpcpp that dispatches between mpd, spotifyd, and mpv
+ rewriting (a **subset** of) GNU coreutils in Python for my work laptop (running Windows 10)

I'm also passionate about international history and culture. I studied Japanese for three years and spent a semester in Nagoya, Japan. This year I'm backpacking across Austria and Hungary.

My career has taken me from political consultancy to pollsters to government contracting. I'm always looking for new experiences to add to that list. For details, see [my CV](/cv).
